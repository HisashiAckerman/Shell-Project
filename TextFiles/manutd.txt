The incident between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez on England duty is 'understandable', according to Manchester United's Victor Lindelof.

After Sterling and Gomez squared up to eachother during Liverpool's victory over Man City at the weekend, tensions were still high as the pair linked up for England duty.


After a disturbance between the two at St George's Park on Monday, England manager Gareth Southgate made Sterling unavailable for selection for the Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro this week.

Sterling claimed emotions got the better of him, and explained how he has settled his differences with Gomez. Southgate then told a press conference: "Raheem in his post last night explained that for a very brief moment his emotions ran over. It would be correct to say that that was not the same for Joe.
